[![Rust](https://github.com/giufus/elasticli.rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/giufus/elasticli.rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml)  

The missing Command Line Interface to interact with Elasticsearch (or yet another one).  
Even if elasticsearch APIs are super easy to invoke and very well documented, I always forget the basic commands and methods to do indexing or searches, so I decided to write my own CLI.  
I hope you find it useful, it is a work in progress.  
  
### Features  
Written in Rust ðŸ¦€, it uses the following crates:  
- [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) for arguments parsing  
- [hydroconf](https://crates.io/crates/hydroconf) for configuration management  
- [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) for http requests toward elasticsearch

If opportunely configured, the command can run inside an SSH tunnel (with auto close after a number of seconds).   

Currently, you can use `elasticli` to:    
- get info about the target elasticsearch version;  
- create, read, ~~update~~, delete an index;  
- create, read, update, delete a document;  

### Changelog  
0.1.2: cross platform building   
0.1.1: basic authentication   
0.1.0: first release  

### Build & Run

#### Option 1
- Build it for your platform with `cargo build --release` (or just type `make`), then go to `target/release` and run the binary `elasticli`.  

#### Option 2
- Alternatively, download the pre-built binary for your platform in the [releases](https://github.com/giufus/elasticli.rs/releases) page. The executable is available for the following targets:  

  - **x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu** -> 64-bit Linux (kernel 3.2+, glibc 2.17+) # CROSS BUILD   
  - **x86_64-pc-windows-msvc** -> 64-bit MSVC (Windows 7+) # BUILT ON WINDOWS ** ***            
  - **x86_64-apple-darwin** -> 64-bit macOS (10.7+, Lion+) # BUILT ON MAC x86_64 **  
  - **aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu** -> ARM64 Linux (kernel 4.1, glibc 2.17+) # CROSS BUILD    
  - **aarch64-apple-darwin** -> ARM64 macOS (11.0+, Big Sur+)  # BUILT ON MAC aarch64     

**: `cross` uses docker images to cross compile, unfortunately windows and apple images are not available at the moment.  
***: on windows, apart from [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you may need to [install perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) to build `elasticli`.

You can get the complete list of rust targets with:    
`rustc --print target-list`  

Your platform is shown in the `host` property of the output of:  
`rustc -vV`  


#### Option 3  
If you want to experience the cross-compilation, install [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) (you may need other dependencies), grab a beer, then run:    
`make <YOUR-TARGET>`  
where the target is one of the outputs of `rustc --print target-list`. Anyway, I have already cross-compiled [some of them]([relases](https://github.com/giufus/elasticli.rs/releases)) for you.   

#### Other 
- If you want to run unit tests run `cargo test`.
- If you want to build and run directly from sources `cargo run -- <your elasticli options and command here>`.  

### Configuration  
- Every command can use the `hydroconf` features to override default configurations. For example you can override some defaults passing environment name as env var to the command line:  
`ENV_FOR_HYDRO=production elasticli info`  
or per single prop, specifying it as an env var to the command line:  
`HYDRO_ELASTIC__PASSWORD="an even stronger password" elasticli info`  

Look at the [hydroconf doc](https://github.com/rubik/hydroconf) for major details.    

- You pass the config root directory with `-c` option before one of the commands (info, index, document). The directory must contain the configuration files (look in the `default` folder for the latest version):  

[.secrets.toml](samples%2Fdefault%2F.secrets.toml)  environment based _sensitive_ configurations (tipically elastic user and password).  
```
[default]
elastic.username = 'elastic'
elastic.password = 'secure_password'

[production]
elastic.username = 'elastic'
elastic.password = 'changeme'
```

[settings.toml](samples%2Fdefault%2Fsettings.toml)  environment based configurations  

```
[default]
# your target elasticsearch host, port, protocol and version
elastic.host = 'otherhost'
elastic.port = 9200
elastic.protocol = 'http'
elastic.version = '8.8.0'

# if enabled, the main command will be executed inside an ssh tunnel. It is the same as running 
###  ssh -i <proxy.key> <proxy.remote_user>@<proxy.host> -f -L <elastic.port>:<elastic.host>:<elastic.port> sleep <proxy.timeout>
###  ssh -i .ssh/some_id_rsa centos@bastion-host -f -L 9200:remote-es.server.es:9200 sleep 3
# but rust does it for you
proxy.enabled = false
proxy.host = 'proxyhost'
proxy.port = 9201
proxy.protocol = 'http'
proxy.user = 'ec2-user'
proxy.remote_user = 'ec2-remote-user'
proxy.key = 'path to ssh key'
proxy.timeout = 3
```

## Commands Showcase

I hope it is understandable enough.

    "successful": 1,
    "total": 2
  },
  "_version": 3,
  "result": "deleted"
}
```


### Defaults
There are some defaults in the code in case you don't specify them:    
- `http` as protocol  
- `127.0.0.1` as host  
- `9200` as port   
- `_doc` as type (used in document deletion)  
- `read` as operation  
- `8.8.0` as es version


### To do  
- write better documentation   
- handle elasticsearch versions (e.g. providing multiple implementations of the trait)  
- integration tests (maybe using something like [testcontainers](https://crates.io/crates/testcontainers))    


### Run elasticsearch locally with docker and no security  
`docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" elasticsearch:8.8.0`


### Run elasticsearch locally with docker and basic authentication  
`docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=true" -e "ELASTIC_PASSWORD=changeme" elasticsearch:8.8.0`
